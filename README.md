# LEGO-Regression-Project
This project tests the significance of the relationship between a LEGO set's attributes and its price.

This project develops a pricing algorithm based on the attributes of a LEGO set using linear regression to analyze the value of individual lego pieces. 

After exploring and cleaning the dataset, a baseline model (which follows the mean) was set and a heatmap correlation was created to determine the predictor variable which has the highest correlation with list price. 

Then a linear regression model was developed and the results are analyzed.
